Jack Riley used Beat Tech on Tate McRae's "Greedy" to create a modern sound that resonates with the current pop landscape. Beat Tech typically involves a mix of electronic elements and production techniques that help elevate a trackâ€™s energy and catchiness, which aligns well with McRae's style. This collaboration likely aimed to enhance the song's appeal and make it more engaging for listeners.
